/** we have three life times for the services.
    builder.Services.AddSingleton() 
        here singleton means that when our application will start up, this will create an instance of our service and will keep it running for as long as the application is alive, so for TokenService we don't need the life time scope, we only need this when the user loging in and when the user do log in we issue the user with the token and we don't need that service again until somebody else logs in, so we don't need that as singleton 
    builder.Services.AddTransient()
        AddTransient will create new instance of our token service for every single request, realistically this is considered to be very short for our purposes.
    builder.Services.AddScoped()
        This is the one that we typically use for our service. This Scoped means that it will be scoped to the level of the HTTP request. So our request comes into our account controller we gonna inject TokenService into our account controller and will be created when the request comes in and will be disposed off when the HTTP request is finised.
    Now in order to use the Interface class (ITokenService) with the implementation class (TokenService) we need to specify ITokenService as the first type parameter in the scope and the TokenService as the second type parameter.

    We gonna inject not the implementation class but the interface class when we use it in the account controller and because we have registered in this way builder.Services.AddScoped<ITokenService, TokenService>(); then the framework knows that when we are using this ITokenService then its implementation class is going to be this (TokenService) one so create the instance of TokenService when we need to create a Token.
