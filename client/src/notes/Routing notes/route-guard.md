# Route Guard in Angular

what angular offers from the rotuing prespective to protect the routes, we are not protecting any thing from the JavaScript prespective. Always remember when the user loads up the application they are downloading the angular code or the angular code that is compiled into javascript code and thats fully downloaded by the browser, so what ever we do from the user interface prespective we don't call that as security, it is something related more to user interface hiding things, because our security will always going to be inplace on the backend API for genuine security but what we can do on the client side of thing because of nature of the single page application, how we download the javacript into the browser, there is only so much  we can do from a security prespective, it not security it is just user interface hiding things.
