export class AccountService {

  //services are both injectable and they are considered singleton, components are different and components are distroyed when they are outside of the scope, this angular service is started when our angular application starts and its gonna be a singleton and survives as long as our application does. So this is the good place to store the state that we need application wide, many components might need the access to the same property, the components can come in and come out of the scope but the angular service will survive as the singleton and will always be available. So Service is the good place for the state and also for the data fetching.

  // constructor() { } we don't need the constructor as now the recommendation from the angular is to use the inject function.
